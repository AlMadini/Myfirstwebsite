        <p>"When I first started practicing, I had the blessing of a supportive family and beautiful friends I could turn to for help and assisstance. But not long after involving myself in the community did I realise that not everybody had that luxury. My Muslim brothers and sisters had to fight and struggle in loneliness to do the same things I had taken for granted. That thought ate away at me. To supplement this, I myself struggled to decipher the various content which the unfiltered tool of the internet presented to me. To think that other Muslims would have to bear that same pain all without anyone out there to help them was enough to make me start on this website. My goal is to contain all of the essential elements which factor in transitioning a Muslim(Submitter to Allah) by name in to a Muhsin(Perfected slave of Allah) in soul and body."</p>
