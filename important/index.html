    <h1>Important Content</h1>
<p>So you've made the decision to start practicing Islam correctly and the way it was meant to be practiced, but what does that mean exactly... <br>
    Don't worry you're in the right place Alhamdulillah. We have split up everything you need to know at the start of this journey into three main categories:
</p>
<br>
 <div>
     <h3><a href="scholars/">Scholars/Speakers</a></h3>
     <p>Scholars are the backbone of Islam, to put it simply they are the most knowledgeable people on the planet in all things related to the religion. They have studied, memorised and understood what an intelligent man would need 40 years to study. Their experience and understanding of the fundamental principles coupled with their memorisation and familiarity of the essential sources means they can sufficiently regulate the misunderstandings of the lay muslims in their confusion. To think that we could get by without the scholars is similar to thinking we could get by without doctors, scientists and the institutions and establishments which unite their work. In fact it is far worse, since a life without health professionals means harm to the body whereas a life without the Scholars is harming the heart and soul. <a href="#">This</a> article further elaborates on this issue.<br> The Speakers or Students of knowledge serve the purpose of connecting the laypeople to these scholars and their works, this is because in the west most people dont know Arabic and are therefore disconnected. The works of these speakers are to be taken with a pinch of salt since their knowledge is nowhere near encyclopedic and they are far more likely to make mistakes in their judgements.</p>
 </div>
 <br>
 <div>
     <h3><a href="books/">Books/Resources</a></h3>
     <p>Islam is reliant upon two major sources. The Qur'an which is the uncreated Speech of Allah the Exalted and the authentic Sunnah which is the Narrations of his Beloved Messenger AlayhiSalaam. The links to books and resources we have provided is specially formulated to meet your fundamental needs on this journey. They are uncomplicated, easy to use, and are built on these two sources. The books are labelled essential, beginner and intermediate depending on the different levels. We also have an <a href="#">Article</a> breaking down the step by step journey we have planned that would leave you spiritually connected with your creator and an all around proficient individual</p>
 </div>
 <br>
 <div>
     <h3><a href="muslim-manual/">The Muslim Manual</a></h3>
     <p>This is perhaps the work we are most proud of, it is a compilation of the bare essentials every Muslim needs to know. This work can be downloaded as a PDF and can be used as a reference point. We have done sufficent research and made sure all of the work is authentic and we have sources linked. The Manual contains things such as: Prayer and everything related to it; Halaal and Haraam, daily requirements; checkboxes to measure progress as well as a journal; this coupled with the <a href="/challenges/">Challenges Page</a> would give you the steady progression required to become a perfect Slave of Allah.
